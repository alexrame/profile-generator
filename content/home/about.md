PhD student at Sorbonne University in Paris under the supervision of Professor Matthieu Cord.
Member of the [VISA-DEEP](https://chaire-visadeep.github.io/) chair of research and teaching in artificial intelligence.
Ex FAIR MetaAI intern.
My works have initially explored how ensembling, weight averaging and invariance can improve the robustness and out-of-distribution generalization in deep learning;
I am now investigating how the generalization literature can help for alignment, to create AGIs benefiting society as a whole, *in all its diversity*.

This is the story of a father and his son. Coming from Beijing, they come to London with different goals. The son hopes to learn and to held a business, the father just follow the stream.

The story itself isn't very interesting. What I liked in this book was the description of racism and inter-generational gap.

English men are deeply racist against Chinese men, but the latter ---especially the old generation-- also hold preconceived ideas on the western culture.

Except the Sun Tzu's Art of War, the Three-Body Problem first tome was my first
Chinese book. The first book set the tone, starting in communist-era in the 70s.

When I introduce this trilogy to friends, I often say ---no spoilers:

> Several of world best theoretical physicists suicide. They all leave a note,
> saying in substance: "Physic doesn't exist".

You don't need to know more to go buy this book. It's hard-science-fiction at its
best.

WARNING, SPOILERS-AHEAD:

The first half of the first book (The Three-Body Problem) is very good. The initial
problem, physic doesn't exist, is both original and extremely exciting. I dislike
the second half, especially the explanation about sophons and how they would
communicate by quantic entanglement ([which doesn't work like this](https://briankoberlein.com/blog/quantum-entanglement/)).

The second book was particularly surprising. I really like the Wallfacers concepts:
four men whose objective is to find a way to defeat high-tech aliens in 300 years.
And they have to keep their plans secret to avoid leaking info through the sophons.
The jump in the future was similar to the movie _the 5th element_ where everything
just seems crazy. And finally come the key idea of this book, and trilogy: the dark forest
hypothesis. It's both terrifying and plausible.

The third book is at first nice, a lot of tech progress is done. However its very
end seems a bit far fetched, closer to fantasy than hard-sf. But I guess when talking
about eons in the future, anything is possible.

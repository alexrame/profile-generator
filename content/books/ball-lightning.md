Ball Lightning is an early book of Cixin Liu, the Three-Body Problem trilogy author.
While not as good as its trilogy, the book was interesting to read because of its theme:
Science.

The protagonists try to understand the ball lightning ([a real phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_lightning)).
The whole book is structured around their experiments, their thoughts, and failures.
The end of the book goes a bit far, and is clearly "science-fiction", but still in a "hard", plausible way.
This won't surprise those who read the trilogy.

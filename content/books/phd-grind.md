PhD Grind ([pdf url](http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf)) is not
strictly speaking a book, but rather a pdf memoir. It is the story of a PhD, during
its six long years, in the USA in Computer Science (Model checking & HCI).

I found this book fantastic. As a first-year PhD, it really talked to me. I was interested
to discover the PhD system in the USA, which sounds quite different from what I know
in France.

I also very much enjoyed the unfiltered speech of a student who had doubts, failures,
and success (spoiler: there is a happy ending.)

If I find motivation, and time, I would like to write such memoir about my own
thesis.

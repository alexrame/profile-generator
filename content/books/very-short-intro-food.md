Very Short Introduction (VSI) is an Oxford collection about various subjects, ranging from humanities
(arts, religion, politics, etc.) to very technical field (neuroscience, physics, etc.). With a small
format (~100 pages), they aim to be a good introduction.

VSI: Food fulfills perfectly this mission. The book is simple enough for a neophyte in food to understand,
and still manages to cover a wide breadth of topics, all centered around food. It's far easier than its
cousin VSI: Nutrition.
